> A Telegram Mini App for building Social Trust through Emotion-Driven Microtasks — powered by TON Blockchain

---

## 🧠 Idea Summary

TrustLayer is a Telegram Mini App that calculates a user's **Social Trust Score** based on their emotional behavior, micro-interactions, and community feedback. Inspired by David R. Hawkins’ *Map of Consciousness*, TrustLayer gamifies inner development and social ethics using TON smart contracts and Telegram-native tools.

## 🎯 Problem

- No trust-based identity layer for Web3 and Telegram communities
- Growing number of scams, anonymous spammers, and low-quality project interactions
- Lack of ethical reputation and emotional alignment across users

---

## 🌈 Solution

A layer of transparent, decentralized social trust — built around tasks that:
- Stimulate real human emotions (reflection, kindness, collaboration)
- Are evaluated by peers (via emoji, reactions, media feedback)
- Are connected to an evolving **Trust Score** on-chain

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Emotion-calibrated microtasks
- Telegram login & TON Connect authentication
- Smart contract storing immutable Trust Scores
- SBT (Soulbound Token) to represent your reputation
- Integration-ready API for other apps (e.g. GameChain)

---

## 🧩 Why It Fits TON

- Leverages TON Connect for secure identity
- Uses Telegram's viral interface to spread engagement
- Implements TON smart contracts and optional SBT
- Enables Stars or Gifts for gratitude-based incentivization

---

## 🚧 MVP Scope (Hackathon Phase)

- Static frontend UI for onboarding and user levels
- TON Connect wallet connection
- Sample emotion task + reaction-based scoring
- Smart contract placeholder for Trust Score registration
